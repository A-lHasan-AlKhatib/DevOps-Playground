# Principles of Agile (Scrum & Kanban)

## Agile
Methodology and mindset for software development that prioritizes iterative development, flexibility, and continuous improvement. It emphasizes collaboration between cross-functional teams, customer feedback, and quick response to change, promoting short development cycles and adaptability over rigid planning and documentation.

## Scrum
Agile methodology and framework for software development that emphasizes short, iterative cycles called sprints, typically lasting 1-4 weeks. It involves self-organizing teams working towards delivering a potentially shippable product increment at the end of each sprint. Scrum includes defined roles (Product Owner, Scrum Master, Development Team) and ceremonies (meetings) such as Sprint Planning, Daily Standup, Sprint Review, and Sprint Retrospective to facilitate the development process and ensure alignment with goals.

## Kanban

Agile methodology that emphasizes visualizing workflow and limiting work in progress (WIP) to optimize flow. It utilizes a Kanban board, which visually represents different stages of work (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done) and tracks tasks as they progress through these stages. Kanban aims to identify and address bottlenecks efficiently. Unlike Scrum, Kanban does not prescribe specific roles or time-boxed iterations, offering greater flexibility in its approach to project management.

## Differences between Scrum and Kanban

| -| Scrum | Kanban |
|------------------------|-------|--------|
| Structure|More structured with sprints and ceremonies | Less structured, continuous flow |
| Planning |	Fixed-length sprints with planned work | Ongoing prioritization and continuous delivery |
| Work In Progress (WIP) | Limited WIP per stage | Focus on managing overall WIP |
| Roles | Specific roles (Product Owner, Scrum Master, Dev Team) | No specific roles required |

## Agile ceremonies

Meetings or events that facilitate communication, collaboration, and alignment within Agile teams.

1. Sprint Planning
 - Who attends: Development team, Scrum master, product owner.
- When does it happen: Beginning of a sprint.
- What framework is this ceremony commonly used in: Scrum, Kanban doesn't have a direct equivalent, but it uses backlog refinement. which is an ongoing process where the team prioritizes and estimates the effort required for backlog items.
- What happens in the meeting: The team collaborates to define goals and select backlog items achievable within the upcoming sprint timeframe.
- Expected output: A clear plan outlining the work for the upcoming sprint.
2. Daily Stand-up
- Who attends: Development team and scrum master (Scrum), anyone interested (Kanban).
- When does it happen: Daily (Scrum & Kanban)
- What framework is this ceremony commonly used in: Scrum & Kanban
- What happens in the meeting: A short meeting for team members to share progress, plans for the day, and any roadblocks encountered.
- Expected output: Improved communication, transparency, and identification of potential issues.
3. Sprint Review
- Who attends: Development team, scrum master, product owner, and stakeholders (Scrum).
- When does it happen: End of a sprint (Scrum)
- What framework is this ceremony commonly used in: Scrum, Kanban doesn't have a direct equivalent, but it uses a Kanban board to visualize workflow and may hold informal reviews to discuss progress.
- What happens in the meeting: Showcase completed work from the sprint and gather feedback from stakeholders.
- Expected output: Transparency and stakeholder feedback on the completed work.
4. Sprint Retrospective
- Who attends: Development team and scrum master (Scrum)
- When does it happen: End of a sprint (Scrum)
- What framework is this ceremony commonly used in: Scrum, Kanban doesn't have a direct equivalent, but it uses a continuous improvement process to identify areas for improvement and implement changes.
- What happens in the meeting: This ceremony is held to reflect on the sprint and identify areas for improvement in the development process.
- Expected output: Identification of areas for improvement in the development process.

### Practicality of Ceremonies

These ceremonies are practical because they provide structured opportunities for teams to collaborate, align on goals, inspect and adapt their process, and gather feedback from stakeholders. They promote transparency, continuous improvement, and help teams stay focused on delivering value to the customer. However, it's essential to tailor these ceremonies to fit the team's specific needs and context, rather than following them blindly.
